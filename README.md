# Bash-Scripting
This repo contains some bash scripts I have created while learning bash scripting via the 
Freecodecamp course available at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

# How to execute these scripts
1. To execute these scripts you have to do `git clone <repo link>`.
2. cd `<repo>`
3. Then to give current user execute permission: `chown u+x <filename>` (You can change directory permissions to apply to all files).
4. After that `./filename.sh`.

**Note: Some files need positional arguments which you have to provide, you can check this by opening the file.**
